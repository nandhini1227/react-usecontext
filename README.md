State Management:

           The App component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the product array. The state includes information about various products, such as their title, description, price, discount percentage, rating, stock, brand, category, and image URLs.
           
Context API:

       The application uses the React.createContext() function to create a UserContext. The product state and the setProduct function are provided to components that subscribe to this context.
       
Product Data:

Product data is an array of objects, each representing a product. Each product has properties such as id, title, description, price, discountPercentage, rating, stock, brand, category, thumbnail, and image. The data seems to be placeholder or dummy data, as indicated by the URLs.

CartCard Component:

The main content of the application is the CartCard component, which is imported from './components/CartCard'. The UserContext.Provider wraps the CartCard component, providing it with access to the product state and the setProduct function through the context.

Container and Styling:

The application uses the Bootstrap CSS framework, as suggested by the use of the container class and my-5 (margin-bottom: 5) class in the div element. This helps in styling and creating a responsive layout.

Rendering:

The CartCard component renders within the container, utilizing the product data provided by the context.
